# 🇦🇺 🇳🇿 Flag Icons 🇬🇧 🇺🇸

Welcome to my curated collection of over 200 4:3 flag icons for every country (and many territories) as SVGs, as well as in PNG and WEBP formats, both of which are in 6 different sizes.

To use them in your code, simply set your images sources to the flags URL at `flags.apteryx.xyz`. Such as:

### ✒️ SVG

```
https://flags.apteryx.xyz/svg/<two_letter_country_code>.svg
```

### 📷 PNG and WEBP

```
https://flags.apteryx.xyz/<format>/<size>/<two_letter_country_code>.<format>
```

-   `format` must be either `webp` or `png`.
-   `size` must be one of 32, 64, 128, 192, 256, or 320.

## 🌐 Examples

Say you wanted to use a PNG image of United States flag, with a height of 64 pixels:

```
https://flags.apteryx.xyz/png/64/us.png
```

![United States flag](https://flags.apteryx.xyz/png/64/us.png)

Or maybe you wanted the New Zealand as a WEBP with a height of 128:

```
https://flags.apteryx.xyz/webp/128/nz.webp
```

![New Zealand flag](https://flags.apteryx.xyz/png/128/nz.png)

Or maybe an SVG of the Hong Kong:

```
https://flags.apteryx.xyz/svg/hk.svg
```

<!-- Limited the height so it doesn't fill the entire screen -->
<img alt="Hong kong flag" src="https://flags.apteryx.xyz/svg/hk.svg" height="100" />
